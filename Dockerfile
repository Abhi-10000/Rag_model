EXPOSE 8080

# FIX: Start the server by running the Python script itself.
# The script will read the $PORT environment variable and start uvicorn correctly.
# NOTE: This assumes your python file is named 'gang.py' as per your previous Dockerfile.
# If your file is named main.py, change "gang.py" to "main.py".
